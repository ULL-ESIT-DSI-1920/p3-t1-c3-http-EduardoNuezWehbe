Writable streams are a widely used concept in Node interfaces. 
All writable streams have a write method, which can be passed a string or a Buffer object. 
Their end method closes the stream and, if given an argument, 
will also write out a piece of data before it does so. 
Both of these methods can also be given a callback as an additional argument, 
which they will call when the writing to or closing of the stream has finished.


it is possible to create a writable stream that points at a file with the 
fs.createWriteStream function

Readable streams are a little more involved. Both the request variable that was passed to the HTTP serverâ€™s 
callback function and the response variable passed to the HTTP client are readable streams.

Objects that emit events in Node have a method called on that is similar to the addEventListener method in 
the browser.

Readable streams have "data" and "end" events. The first is fired every time some data comes in, and the second 
is called whenever the stream is at its end. fs.createReadStream
