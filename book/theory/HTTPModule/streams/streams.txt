Writable streams are a widely used concept in Node interfaces. 
All writable streams have a write method, which can be passed a string or a Buffer object. 
Their end method closes the stream and, if given an argument, 
will also write out a piece of data before it does so. 
Both of these methods can also be given a callback as an additional argument, 
which they will call when the writing to or closing of the stream has finished.


it is possible to create a writable stream that points at a file with the 
fs.createWriteStream function

Readable streams are a little more involved. Both the request variable that was passed to the HTTP serverâ€™s 
callback function and the response variable passed to the HTTP client are readable streams.
